The Upbound Crossplane Architecture Framework provides recommendations and describes best practices to help architects, platform teams, administrators, and other cloud practitioners design API abstractions and operate control planes that are secure, efficient, resilient, and high-performing.

The Crossplane experts at Upbound have validated the design recommendations and best practices defined in this framework. As Crossplaneâ€™s capabilities grow and the industry evolves, this framework will continue to reflect current best practices. 

The design guidance in this framework applies to platforms built for the cloud. The five pillars of this framework are:

- **System design**
- **Operational Excellence**
- **Performance Optimization**
- **Security and Compliance**
- **Reliability**

This framework organizes content into three sections:

- **Constructing custom APIs** defines a set of best practices for how organizations should approach building custom APIs using Crossplane compositions and configurations.
- **Architecting with control planes** defines a set of viable design patterns that can be used when architecting with control planes.
- **Interface integrations** provides baseline recommendations for integrating with common control plane interfaces (frontends, monitoring, etc).  


This framework defines a set of viable patterns that can be used when architecting with control planes.
